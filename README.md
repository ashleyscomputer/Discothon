# SheShield

SheShield is a stealth personal safety companion designed for high-risk contexts such as GBV and everyday harassment in South Africa.

The app appears on a survivor's phone as a harmless everyday tool (notes, calculator, lists, budgeting or study timer) while secretly wiring in:
- silent panic activation using safe gestures and phrases
- location and context capture for escalation
- configurable trusted contacts and support channels
- audit-friendly logs for investigators and case workers

This repository contains the web prototype used for hackathon judging and usability testing.
